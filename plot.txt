Theme:
● This a jumping game setting in the forrest. The player is jumping on randomly placed tree stumps (front/right/left with straight angle).

Interactivity:
● Press and hold “j” to jump, jump distance proportional to duration of key press
● Goal is to jump on as many blocks as possible
● If the player misses a platform, the avatar will fall; game over.
● Game is over and restarts when you don’t land on a block, after 5 seconds\
● Press "r" to restart the game immediately
● The path is generated dynamically.
● Score board on top of the screen display successful jumps completed

Course Topics:
● Shading and Lighting of the objects in the scene
● Collision detection: whether avatar touched the platform edge without landing on it
● Physics simulation: animating projectile motion of the jumping avatar
● Normal Texture Mapping/Bump Mapping for trees and surroundings
● Tree stump use randomly selected texture to increase aesthetics
● Camera follows the avatar smoothly

Advanced Features:
● Collision detection
● Score board
● Animation of avatar preparing to jump
● Implemented skybox for background

Other Features:
● Randomly placed trees/background to increase interactivity
● Smooth transition of camera from stump to stump
● Zig-zagging of jump course in the X and Z axis
● Optimizations made for playability of game
